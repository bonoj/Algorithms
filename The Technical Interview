The Technical Interview: Algorithms and Data Structures
Algorithm - a program that solves a problem.

Introduction and Efficiency

Efficiency: also called complexity - how well computer resources of time and space are used
Time: how long does the code take to run
Space: how much storage space does your code occupy

Notation of Efficiency - for both time and space efficiency:

Big O Notation: O(1), O(log(n), O(sqrt(n)) O(n), O(n * log(n)), O(n^2), O(n^3), etc.
where n is the length of the input to the function. (Size of list or data)

List-Based Collections:

Lists/Arrays:
Arrays: arrays have indices, numbered from 0 to n - 1
Insertion is O(n)

Linked Lists:
No indices. Each element knows something about the next element (that it is linked to)
In each element, you store a reference (the memory address) to the next element.
Insertion is O(1)

Stacks:
First in, last out.
