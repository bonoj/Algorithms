# Hash Tables and Hash Functions

# In this quiz, you'll write your own hash table and
# hash function that uses string keys. Your table will
# store strings in buckets by their first two letters,
# according to the formula below:
#
# Hash Value = (ASCII Value of First Letter * 100) + ASCII Value of Second Letter
# You can assume that the string will have at least two letters,
# and the first two characters are uppercase letters
# (ASCII values from 65 to 90). You can use the Python
# function ord() to get the ASCII value of a letter, and chr()
# to get the letter associated with an ASCII value.
#
# You'll create a HashTable class, methods to store and lookup values,
# and a helper function to calculate a hash value given a string.
# You cannot use a Python dictionaryâ€”only lists!
# And remember to store lists at each bucket, and not
# just the string itself.
# For example, you can store "UDACITY" at index 8568 as ["UDACITY"].

# """Write a HashTable class that stores strings
# in a hash table, where keys are calculated
# using the first two letters of the string."""
