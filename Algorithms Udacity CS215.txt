Graphs / Networks

Node / Vertices
Edges /Links: link nodes
Degree of a node is number of edges connected to that node.

Eulerian path - path through a graph along the edges that only hits each edge once while visiting all the nodes in a graph.

Eulerian Tour - special kind of Eulerian path where you start and end at the same node.

Divide and Conquer:
Break a problem into roughly equal sized subproblems, solve them separately, and then combine results.

Types of Networks:

Chain Network: o----o-----o-----o-----o      5 nodes, 4 edges.
m = n - 1       m edges with n nodes


Ring Network: o----o-----o-----o-----o
              |----------------------|

Chain network with loop completed. 5 nodes, 5 edges.
m = n          m edges with n nodes


Grid Network
n = 20, m = 15 + 16 = 31


Complete Set:
f(n) is in o(g(n)) == f(n) < g(n)               little o
f(n) is in O(g(n)) == f(n) <= g(n)              Big O
f(n) is in big theta(g(n)) == f(n) = g(n)       Big Theta
f(n) is in big omega(g(n)) == f(n) >= g(n)      Big Omega
f(n) is in little omega(g(n)) == f(n) > g(n)   little omega

Planar Graphs: Graph drawn on a plane such that the edges don't cross.

n = 5, m = 6, r = 3         where n is a node, m is an edge, and r is a region.
Relationship between n, m, and r: For any planar, n - m + r = 2

Growth rate of edges in planar graph:
every region must be bounded by at least 3 edges.
so with n - m + r = 2 in mind, 3 * regions (3r) must be less than 2 * edges (2m)
3r <= 2m, r <= 2/3 * m
m + 2 = n + r <= n + 2/3 * m
3m + 6 <= 3n + 2m
m <= 3n - 6 which is in BigTheta(n) (linear)

Recap:
For chain, ring, grid, and planar graphs, the relationship of m with regards to n is in BigTheta(n). That is, their growth as n nodes increases is linear - f(n) = g(n)


Complete Graph: aka Clique
Each node in a graph is connected to each other node, e.g. a 5 node graph ends up with a star in a pentagon, 5 nodes and 10 edges.

m = n * (n-1) / 2 which is in BigTheta(n^2). That is, the growth relationship of m with regards to n is quadratic.
