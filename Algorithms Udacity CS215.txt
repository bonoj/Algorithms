Graphs / Networks

Node / Vertices
Edges /Links: link nodes
Degree of a node is number of edges connected to that node.

Eulerian path - path through a graph along the edges that only hits each edge once while visiting all the nodes in a graph.

Eulerian Tour - special kind of Eulerian path where you start and end at the same node.

Divide and Conquer:
Break a problem into roughly equal sized subproblems, solve them separately, and then combine results.

Types of Networks:

Chain Network: o----o-----o-----o-----o      5 nodes, 4 edges.
m = n - 1       m edges with n nodes


Ring Network: o----o-----o-----o-----o
              |----------------------|

Chain network with loop completed. 5 nodes, 5 edges.
m = n          m edges with n nodes
