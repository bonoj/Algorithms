Graphs:

Node.
Edges link nodes.
Degree of a node is number of edges connected to that node.

Eulerian path - path through a graph along the edges that only hits each edge once while visiting all the nodes in a graph.

Eulerian Tour - special kind of Eulerian path where you start and end at the same node.

Divide and Conquer:
Break a problem into roughly equal sized subproblems, solve them separately, and then combine results.
