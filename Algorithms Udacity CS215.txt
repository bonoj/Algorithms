Graphs / Networks

Node / Vertices
Edges /Links: link nodes
Degree of a node is number of edges connected to that node.

Eulerian path - path through a graph along the edges that only hits each edge once while visiting all the nodes in a graph.

Eulerian Tour - special kind of Eulerian path where you start and end at the same node.

Divide and Conquer:
Break a problem into roughly equal sized subproblems, solve them separately, and then combine results.

Types of Networks:

Chain Network: o----o-----o-----o-----o      5 nodes, 4 edges.
m = n - 1       m edges with n nodes


Ring Network: o----o-----o-----o-----o
              |----------------------|

Chain network with loop completed. 5 nodes, 5 edges.
m = n          m edges with n nodes


Grid Network
n = 20, m = 15 + 16 = 31


Complete Set:
f(n) is in o(g(n)) == f(n) < g(n)               little o
f(n) is in O(g(n)) == f(n) <= g(n)              Big O
f(n) is in big theta(g(n)) == f(n) = g(n)       Big Theta
f(n) is in big omega(g(n)) == f(n) >= g(n)      Big Omega
f(n) is in little omega(g(n)) == f(n) > g(n)   little omega
